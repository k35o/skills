description: Preview generated Markdown (plans, design notes, reviews, research reports) in the user's browser. Use when sharing long, structured output — documents with headings, tables, code blocks, or Mermaid diagrams — that is hard to read in the terminal.

# mdscroll

Serve generated Markdown to the local mdscroll preview server so the user can read it in their browser. It renders content with GitHub-style styling, Shiki syntax highlighting, Mermaid diagrams, GFM alerts, task lists, and tables. Point it at a file and every change to that file is auto-reloaded in the browser over Server-Sent Events.

## When to use

Use this skill when ANY of the following is true:

- The user explicitly asks: "show it in the browser", "preview this", "open it in mdscroll", or similar
- You produced a structured document (roughly 20+ lines, or containing headings, tables, code blocks, or Mermaid) that would be cumbersome to read scrolling the terminal
- You are delivering a plan, design doc, code review, or research report — the kind of output the user will sit down and read

Do NOT use this for short answers, one-off replies, or small code snippets.

## How to use

mdscroll is a foreground process with two input shapes.

### 1) Write to a file, let mdscroll watch it (preferred for iterative work)

```bash
# Agent writes the doc to a file under the user's cwd:
cat > docs/plan.md <<'MDSCROLL_EOF'
# Title

Body...
MDSCROLL_EOF

# Then tell the user to run (or start it in a separate pane):
mdscroll docs/plan.md
```

As you update `docs/plan.md` in later turns, the browser auto-reloads within ~100 ms. This is the right shape when the user wants to keep reading while you iterate.

### 2) Stream once via stdin (good for throwaway output)

```bash
cat <<'MDSCROLL_EOF' | mdscroll
# Title

Body...
MDSCROLL_EOF
```

The server renders the piped markdown once and stays foreground until Ctrl+C. No auto-reload — if you want to push an updated version, re-run the command.

## Output

mdscroll prints the URL and keeps running:

```
mdscroll running at http://127.0.0.1:4977
```

mdscroll never opens a browser itself. Hand the URL to the user or, if the host environment supports it, open it through the environment's browser helper (e.g. `cmux browser open-split <url>` inside cmux).

## Steps

1. Decide between file-watch mode (when the user will iterate on the content) and stdin mode (one-shot output).
2. For file-watch: write the Markdown to a file under the user's cwd, then suggest `mdscroll <file>` (or run it yourself in a separate pane).
3. For stdin: pipe the content to `mdscroll` using a heredoc.
4. Confirm the URL was printed, then point the user at it.

## Useful flags

- `--port <n>` / `--host <h>` — defaults are `127.0.0.1:4977`; if the port is taken mdscroll falls back to a free one.

## What mdscroll does NOT do

- There is no persistent background server and no subcommand surface. `mdscroll push`, `mdscroll stop`, `mdscroll list`, and `--name` existed in 0.1.x but were removed in 0.2.0. One foreground process per preview.
- It writes nothing to disk — no lockfile, no log, no `~/.mdscroll/`.
- It does not auto-open a browser.

## When the command is missing

If `mdscroll: command not found` appears, guide the user to install:

```bash
pnpm add -g mdscroll   # or: npm i -g mdscroll
```
